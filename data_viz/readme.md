# Data Visualization with the HoloViews Suite

From the [HoloViews](http://holoviews.org/) website:
> HoloViews is an open-source Python library designed to make data analysis and visualization seamless and simple. With HoloViews, you can usually express what you want to do in very few lines of code, letting you focus on what you are trying to explore and convey, not on the process of plotting.

HoloViews is supported by Anaconda and plays well with the PyViz family of libraries. Personally, I think it's easier to use than the alternatives and lets a data scientist do nearly anything they need to.

This directory contains several examples, as notebooks or stand-alone apps, for:
* Basic Plotting
* Interactivity
* Streaming
