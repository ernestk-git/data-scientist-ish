    "# The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "From an interesting queston posed on stackoverflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53489058/improved-efficiency-versus-iterating-over-two-large-pandas-dataframes/\n",
    "\n",
    "The premise:\n",
    "With two large arrays of lat-lng coordinates, obtain the number of points a coordinate in the first array is \"close\" (within 1 km) to in the second array. So if we have two arrays (_n x 2_ and _k x 2_ where _n > k_), the resulting array should be an array of counts of dimension $n$, representing the number of times a point in the first $n$ array is within 1 km of a point within the $k$ array.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the case of the question posed, $n = 10,000,000$ and $k = 1,000,000$. On a naive basis, you would have to calculate $10,000,000 x 1,000,000$ or $10,000,000,000,000$ distances. Unless you can accomplish this on a nanosecond timescale, this task would take a very long time (by the question poser's own estimate, some 6000 hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will go over several approaches:\n",
    "* A naive serial approach using `geopy`: Easy to program, probably your first pass at solving this problem\n",
    "* A multiprocessing version of the serial approach\n",
    "* Parallelized Numba on CPU: Requires knowledge of `Numpy`, `Numba`, and vectorizing code, but fairly straightforward\n",
    "* Vectorized Numba-CUDA: Requires the above, plus writing `guvectorize` functions to handle complicated array-to-array calculations, and working with CUDA limitations (no `Numpy` typically)\n",
    "* Numba-CUDA Custom Kernel: Requires managing host-to-gpu memory transfers, managing the CUDA grid/thread schema, and working with the CUDA limitations\n",
    " \n",

    "\n",
    "The following implementation utilizes two simple loops and the latitude filter mentioned above. Additionally, it leans on geopy for a distance function (`great_circle` which is akin to haversine distance). The `great_circle` implementation is much quicker than `geodesic`, but we'll see later that it doesn't hold up to a numba-accelerated function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I didn't initally, I will be using the latitude filter that was suggested and implemented in the stackoverflow post. The distance between latitudes (straight north-south) maps pretty consistently to actual distance in km (slightly varies since the Earth is not a perfect sphere). By picking the distance criterion and dividing it by 100, it should eliminate those points (based on latitude alone) that would too far away to be worth calculating the actual distance."

Additionally, we have to tell the gpu how we're going to iterate over these structures while completing this work. Fortunately, Numba exposes a few helper functions like `cuda.grid()` and `cuda.gridsize()`.\n",

    "Basically, the first for-loop will iterate through each thread within each block, then continue on to the next block. However, we won't need to manually keep track of CUDA's numbering scheme. Instead, we'll be iterating through all of the blocks and threads but we'll get to treat i as ranging from `0, 1, 2, 3,..., End_of_the_array`. Since we know `out` will be of equal size to `coord1`, we can write directly to `out[i]` without worrying about simultaneousy read/writes. \n",

This behaviour prevents us from having to write some kind of data-loader, which is awesome. These threads will execute in blocks of 1024, 36 grids at a time. These numbers were picked due to the number of stream processors available on my particular hardware, and trial-and-error."

    "Hooray, an RTX 2070 is about 16x faster at this task than a Ryzen 1600 (6-Core, 12-Threads). That's a nice little speed up for what was a first pass. The secret to getting insane speed-ups out of CUDA Kernels is to leverage **shared memory** (a high-speed cache per grid) as much as possible. However, for this problem, the two coordinate sets would exceed the limits of this cache. I'm certain that with a different grid/thread layout, I could have used shared memory, but this example wasn't too difficult to code while yielding a substantial gain in speed."
