# Musings of a Data Science Student

Hi, my name is Ernest and I am currently a student at the University of San Francisco, Masters of Analytics program.  Named 'Analytics' several years before 'data science' caught fire, this program takes neophyte data wranglers and turns them into full-fledged data scientists over a 12-month rigorous program of stats, machine learning, deep learning and other areas of software development and maths.

Most of the students come from the sciences: computer science, math, engineering and various others.  However, I earned degrees in Philosophy and Political Science.  Although I have tinkered with computers my entire life, I am writing from that perspective: a little knowledge of computers, a dip in the maths, but mostly from scratch.

This git contains lessons, best practices, projects, and other musings from my time at MSAN.  So let's begin:
